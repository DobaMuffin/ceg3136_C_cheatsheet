# Getting Setup
## Installing a c compiler 
### Installing C compiler on MacOS

	* If you do not have brew setup follow instructions here: [The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux) â€” Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
### Installing C compiler on Windows 
* Pending
### Installing C compiler on Linux
* Pending

## Hello World Script
### Sample Code:
```
/* Hello World program */
#include <stdio.h>

void main(void){
printf("Hello World.\n");
}
```
### Running Hello world
1. Copy and paste the above sample code into a text editor of your choice. (If you don't have one visit the [Code focused text editors](#some-code-focused-text-editors) for examples) 
2. Save the file as `HelloWorld.c`
3. Open your preferred command line program and navigate to the directory in which you stored the above file.
4. Run the following command `gcc -o HelloWorld.out HelloWorld.c`
5. There should now be a file in that directory called `HelloWorld.out`
6. Depending on system you will have to run `./HelloWorld.out` or `HelloWorld.out`
7. If you have run these commands successfully you should see an output in your terminal that looks like `Hello World.`
